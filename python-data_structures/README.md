0. Print a list of integers

Task: Print each integer in a list.

How: Loop through the list and print each element.

1. Secure access to an element in a list

Task: Return an element at a given index or None if invalid.

How: Check if index is within bounds, then return the element.

2. Replace element

Task: Replace an element at a given index; do nothing if invalid.

How: Check index, then assign the new value to that position.

3. Print a list of integers in reverse

Task: Print integers in reverse order.

How: Loop through the list backwards and print each element.

4. Replace in a copy

Task: Replace an element but keep the original list unchanged.

How: Make a copy of the list, replace in the copy, return it.

5. Remove all 'c' and 'C'

Task: Remove all 'c' and 'C' characters from a string.

How: Loop through the string, add characters to new string only if not 'c' or 'C'.

6. Print a matrix of integers

Task: Print a 2D list with each row on a line.

How: Loop through each row and print elements separated by space.

7. Add 2 tuples

Task: Add first two elements of two tuples; use 0 for missing elements.

How: Extend tuples with zeros if needed, add first and second elements, return as tuple.

8. Multiple returns

Task: Return length of string and its first character; None if empty.

How: Use len() for length; check if string is empty to pick first character.

9. Find the max

Task: Return the largest integer in a list.

How: Loop through the list, track the maximum value; return None if empty.

10. Find multiples of 2

Task: Return a list of True/False if each number is divisible by 2.

How: Loop through list, check number % 2 == 0 for each element.

11. Delete at

Task: Delete element at index; do nothing if invalid.

How: Check index, remove element by slicing.

12. Switch

Task: Swap the values of a and b.

How: Use a temporary variable or Python’s tuple swap (a, b = b, a).
